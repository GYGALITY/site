            <p class="origin-description">
                LeBron James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio.
                He was raised by his mother, Gloria James, who was just 16 years
                old when he was born. Life was difficult for them — they moved
                frequently and faced financial hardships, sometimes even struggling
                to find stable housing. Despite these challenges, Gloria did everything
                she could to support her son. From a young age, LeBron showed remarkable
                talent in sports, especially basketball, and it quickly became clear he
                had a special gift.

            <p class="origin-description">
                As a teenager, LeBron attended St. Vincent–St.
                Mary High School in Akron, where he became a national
                basketball sensation. His skills on the court attracted major
                media attention, and he was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated
                while still in high school — a rare feat. He led his team to multiple
                state championships and was widely regarded as the best high school
                basketball player in the country. During this time, he also dealt with
                the pressure of fame and the expectations of becoming a future NBA star.

                LeBron James was drafted into the NBA in 2003 as the first
                overall pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Since then, he has had
                a legendary career, winning multiple NBA championships with the
                Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Los Angeles Lakers. Off the
                court, LeBron is known for his philanthropy, including opening the
                “I PROMISE” School in Akron for at-risk children. He has also become
                a successful businessman and activist, using his platform to speak out
                on social and political issues. Today, he is considered one of the
                greatest basketball players of all time.
